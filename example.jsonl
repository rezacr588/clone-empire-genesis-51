How do we proceed?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So, basically, the process is very, very simple.

Let's say to be fully paid and be close to the date of completion."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah, so, usually, basically, our standard payment plan is, and this is, by the way, it's not set in stone, so we're flexible."}, {"role": "user", "content": "It costs less than $4,000. Yeah, $4,000."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So it would be like $3,000 something euros.

For right. Okay. And you do all the paperwork."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So it's a super simple process. And you can see here, I have like an FAQ sheet here. And I mean, the process includes registering what we call a PTPMA, PTPMA, which is the same as a foreign-owned company in Indonesia."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay, so let's say we signed the agreement as individuals. Correct, correct."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You signed the agreement as you make a bank transfer to Coco and then once we are close to handover, we open up the account so you'll receive all the funds from rental income to the Indonesian company."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Okay, so when we transfer the money and then we create the company, how are going to transfer the ownership to the company?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So it's very simple, it's just like a like it's like Ownership the ownership of the company will be mainly to receive the funds from the rental income if that makes sense so it's not that the title deed is transferring from private to to company you know what I mean like now yeah the company is just to receive the funds from the rental income."}, {"role": "user", "content": "All right.
